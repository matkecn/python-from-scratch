Files let your code remember things after it stops.

**Section** Files, paths and serialization · **Level** 2 of 5 · **Time** about 15 minutes · **Status** generated draft (Phase 2)

## You will learn

- `open` a file to read or write
- `with` closes it for you
- Use `pathlib` for paths

## 1. Run the example

```bash
python 477-file-permissions/lesson_477_file_permissions.py
```

## 2. Read the code

    print(save_lines(["one", "two"], target))

## 3. Run the tests

pytest 477-file-permissions
```

## 4. Open the notebook

```

## Words to remember

| word | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `file` | Text or data saved on disk |
| `context manager` | The object behind `with`, which tidies up for you |
